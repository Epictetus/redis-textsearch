= Redis::TextSearch - Use Redis to perform full text search with any type of class or data store

This gem implements an extremely fast test search using Redis, based on the patterns from
James Gray's {lists and sets in Redis post}[http://blog.grayproductions.net/articles/lists_and_sets_in_redis]
as well as Antirez's {text search gist}[http://gist.github.com/120067]. You can use it with any type of class,
whether it be ActiveRecord, DataMapper, MongoRecord, or even a class having nothing todo with an ORM.

This is not intended to be the most full-featured text search available.
